Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression  no-unused-expressions

This happens because you put bracket of return on the next line. That might be a common mistake if you write js without semicolons and use a style where you put opened braces on the next line.
Interpreter thinks that you return undefined and doesn't check your next line. That's the return operator thing.
Put your opened bracket on the same line with the return.
